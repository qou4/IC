Once upon a time, there was a kindom that everyone was learning the magic of programming. 
They utilized this magic for everything - just everything you could imagine, from making the world a better place to defeating the devils, and so on.

Middle by Hongru Zhou:
This was when unnormal things happening. By using the magic of programming, people in this kindom created a type of puppets, which could help them doing heavy work. However, the magic did not only bring physical ability to the puppets but also intelligence. It was still not clear what the exact date that puppets decide not to obey people's orders and rules was. Now, all puppets leave people behind and go to another place which is probably far away from the kindom since no one knows where they go.

Final piece by Tong Jiao:
They abandoned all the memories and decide to start a completely new life as normal human there. They lived in there peacefully and centries passed. One day, there is a talented puppet realized one thing: why don't we create some robots to help us do those tiring physical work? Days later, the first automatic robot is created by that genius and come into use...
